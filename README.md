# Ultra-Low-Power Physical-Response AI Substrate Using Mg-Doped 1T-TaS₂

1. Abstract

This repository proposes an experimental framework to investigate nonlinear phase dynamics in Mg-doped 1T-TaS₂ as a candidate physical substrate for ultra-low-power analog AI systems. The focus is on charge density wave (CDW) phase stability, multi-state electronic behavior, and measurable nonlinear response suitable for reservoir-style computation.

2. Background

1T-TaS₂ is a transition metal dichalcogenide known for its charge density wave (CDW) phases and temperature-dependent phase transitions. These phases exhibit nonlinear electronic behavior, hysteresis, and multi-stable states.

Recent interest in analog and physical reservoir computing suggests that nonlinear materials with intrinsic memory effects may serve as low-power computational substrates.

Magnesium doping may influence defect density, electronic band structure, and phase stability. This work explores whether controlled Mg incorporation (e.g., ~2.8 at.%) can modulate CDW stability and enhance multi-state behavior relevant for analog computation.

3. Hypothesis

Mg doping in 1T-TaS₂ modifies phase stability and defect-mediated electronic response, potentially enhancing:
	•	Multi-stable electronic states
	•	Nonlinear I–V characteristics
	•	Hysteresis width and controllability
	•	Low-energy state transitions

These properties may support physical-response-based analog computational architectures.

4. Proposed Experimental Framework

Material Preparation
	•	Thin film growth via CVD or MBE
	•	Controlled Mg doping (~2–3 at.%)
	•	Structural verification via XRD

Characterization
	•	STM or TEM for CDW domain observation
	•	Raman spectroscopy for phase confirmation
	•	I–V measurements for nonlinear response
	•	Temperature-dependent transport analysis

Dynamic Testing
	•	Pulse input experiments
	•	Response time measurement
	•	Multi-state switching stability tests

5. Measurable Predictions

If the hypothesis holds, Mg-doped samples should demonstrate:
	•	Modified CDW phase boundaries
	•	Enhanced hysteresis controllability
	•	Reduced energy threshold for state switching
	•	Repeatable nonlinear response suitable for signal mapping

⸻

6. Falsifiability

The hypothesis would be falsified if:
	•	Mg incorporation does not measurably alter CDW phase stability
	•	No significant nonlinear enhancement is observed
	•	Energy thresholds remain comparable to undoped samples
	•	Multi-state behavior does not improve

7. Scope and Limitations

This project does not claim autonomous intelligence or zero-energy computation. The focus is limited to material-level nonlinear dynamics and potential applicability to ultra-low-power analog AI architectures.

8. Future Computational Modeling

Future work may include density functional theory (DFT) simulations to estimate Mg-induced modifications in electronic band structure and CDW stability, as well as numerical modeling of nonlinear response under pulsed inputs.
